# Data Analyst Study Project - Fitness Club Client Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to predict client churn in a fitness club. It involves several key steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights into client behavior, including examining patterns in churn. For data exploration and visualization techniques we use python libraries (**Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn**).
3. Predictive Modeling: Building machine learning models using **linear regression** and **random forest** from **sklearn** library to forecast client churn.
4. Cluster Analysis: Using K-Means clustering from sklearn library to group clients based on their characteristics and churn likelihood.

## Results
The project's results, including churn prediction models, visualizations, and cluster analysis, can be found in the Jupyter notebook. This notebook provides valuable insights and conclusions regarding client churn in the fitness club.

The project is organized as follows:
- [Notebook](https://github.com/kakao-panda/Data_Analyst/blob/main/Yandex_Data_Analyst_Project_ML_churn_rate_github.ipynb):  Jupyter notebook that includes data preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and cluster analysis.
- `README.md`: The primary project documentation file.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project is provided by Yandex.Practicum and is subject to copyright restrictions. I can't include the data in repository but provide the Jupyter Notebook with results.
